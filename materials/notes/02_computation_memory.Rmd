# Components of a standard computing environment

Figure \@ref(fig:components) illustrates the key components of a standard computing environment to process digital data. In our case, these components serve the purpose of computing a statistic, given a large data set as input. 

```{r components, echo=FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= "(ref:components)", purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/03_script-hardware_w.jpg")
```

(ref:components) Basic components of a standard computing environment.

- The component actually *processing* data is the Central Processing Unit (CPU). When using R to process data, R commands are translated into complex combinations of a small set of basic operations which the *CPU* then executes. 

- In order to work with data (e.g., in R), it first has to be loaded into the *memory* of our computer. More specifically, into the Random Access Memory (*RAM*). Typically, data is only loaded in the RAM as long as we work with it. 

- *Mass Storage* refers to the type of computer memory we use to store data in the long run. This is what we call the *hard drive* or *hard disk*. In these days, the relevant hard disk is actually often not the one physically built into our computer but a hard disk 'in the cloud' (built into a server to which we connect over the Internet).

Very simply put, the difference between 'data analytics' and 'Big Data analytics' is that in the latter case, the standard usage of one or several of these components fails or works very inefficiently because the amount of data overwhelms its normal capacity. 

From this hardware-perspective, there are two basic strategies to cope with the situation that one of these components is overwhelmed by the amount of data:

- *Scale up ('horizontal scaling')*: Extend the physical capacity of the affected component by building a system with large RAM shared between applications. This sounds like a trivial solution ('if RAM is too small, buy more RAM...'), but in practice it can be very expensive. 
- *Scale out ('vertical scaling')*: Distribute the workload over several computers (or separate components of a system). 

From a software-perspective, there are many (context-specific) strategies that can help us to use the resources available more efficiently in order to process large amounts of data. In the context of computing statistics based on big data, this can involve:

- Implementing the computation of a given statistical procedure in a more efficient way (make better use of a given programming language or choose another programming language).
- Choosing/implementing a more efficient statistical procedure/algorithm (see, e.g., the *Uluru* algorithm).
- At a lower level, improving how the system allocates resources.




# Units of information/data storage

The smallest unit of information in computing/digital data is called a *bit* (from *bi*nary dig*it*; abbrev. 'b') and can take one of two (symbolic) values, either a `0` or a `1` ("off" or "on"). Consider, for example, the decimal number `139`. Written in the binary system, `139` corresponds to the binary number `10001011`. In order to store this number on a hard disk, we require a capacity of 8 bits, or one *byte* (1 byte = 8 bits; abbrev. 'B'). Historically, one byte encoded a single character of text (i.e., in the ASCII character encoding system). 4 bytes (or 32 bits) are called a *word*. When thinking of a given data set in its raw/binary representation, we can simply think of it as a row of `0`s and  `1`s, as illustrated in the following figure. 

```{r bitbyteword, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= "(ref:capbitbyteword)", purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/03_store-bitbyteword.png")
```

Bigger units for storage capacity usually build on bytes:

 - $1 \text{ kilobyte (KB)} = 1000^{1}   \approx 2^{10}   \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ megabyte (MB)} = 1000^{2}   \approx 2^{20}   \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ gigabyte (GB)} = 1000^{3}   \approx 2^{30}   \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ terabyte (TB)} = 1000^{4}   \approx 2^{40}   \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ petabyte (PB)} = 1000^{5}   \approx 2^{50}   \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ exabyte (EB)} = 1000^{6}    \approx 2^{60}   \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ zettabyte (ZB)} = 1000^{7}  \approx 2^{70}   \text{ bytes}$

$$1 ZB = 1000000000000000000000\text{ bytes} = 1 \text{ billion terabytes} = 1 \text{ trillion gigabytes}.$$

## Example in R: Data types and information storage

Given the fact that computers only understand `0`s and `1`s, different approaches are taken to map these digital values to other symbols or images (text, decimal numbers, pictures, etc.) that we humans can more easily make sense of. Regarding text and numbers, these mappings involve *character encodings* (in which combinations of `0`s and `1`s represent a character in a specific alphabet) and *data types*.

Let's illustrate the main concepts with the simple numerical example from above. When we see the decimal number `139` written somewhere, we know that it means 'one-hundred-and-thirty-nine'. The fact that our computer is able to print `139` on the screen means that our computer can somehow map a sequence of `0`s and `1`s to the symbols `1`, `3`, and `9`. Depending on what we want to do with the data value `139` on our computer, there are different ways of how the computer can represent this value internally. Inter alia, we could load it into RAM as a *string* ('text'/'character') or as an *integer* ('natural number') or *double* (numeric, floating point number). All of them can be printed on screen but only the latter two can be used for arithmetic computations. This concept can easily be illustrated in R.

We initiate a new variable with the value `139`. By using this syntax, R by default initiates the variable as an object of type `double`. We then can use this variable in arithmetic operations.

```{r}
my_number <- 139
# check the class
typeof(my_number)

# arithmetic
my_number*2
```

When we change the *data type* to 'character' (string) such operations are not possible.

```{r error=TRUE}
# change and check type/class
my_number_string <- as.character(my_number)
typeof(my_number_string)

# try to multiply
my_number_string*2
```

If we change the variable to type `integer`, we can still use math operators.

```{r}
# change and check type/class
my_number_int <- as.integer(my_number)
typeof(my_number_int)
# arithmetics
my_number_int*2
```

Having all variables in the right type is relevant for data analytics with all kind of sample sizes. However, given the fact that different data types have to be represented differently internally, different types might take up more or less memory and therefore substantially affect the performance when dealing with massive amounts of data. 

We can illustrate this point with `object.size()`:
```{r}
object.size("139")
object.size(139)
```




# Resource allocation 

When optimizing the performance of an analytics program processing large amounts of data, it is useful to differentiate between the efficient allocation of computational (CPU) power, and the allocation of RAM (and mass storage).^I[n many data analysis tasks the two are, of course, intertwined. However, keeping both aspects in mind when optimizing an analytics program helps to choose the right tools.] Below, we will look at both aspects in turn. 


## R-tools to investigate performance/resource allocation

package | function | purpose
-------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------
`utils`  | `object.size()` | Provides an estimate of the memory that is being used to store an R object.
`pryr`   | `object_size()` | Works similarly to `object.size()`, but counts more accurately and includes the size of environments.
`pryr` | `compare_size()` | Makes it easy to compare the output of object_size and object.size.
`pryr` | `mem_used()`     | Returns the total amount of memory (in megabytes) currently used by R.
`pryr` | `mem_change()`   | Shows the change in memory (in megabytes) before and after running code.
`base`   | `system.time()` | Returns CPU (and other) times that an R expression used.
`microbenchmark` | `microbenchmark()` | Highly accurate timing of R expression evaluation.
`profvis`| `profvis()`   | Profiles an R expression and visualizes the profiling data (usage of memory, time elapsed, etc.)


## Case study: Parallel processing

In this example, we estimate a simple regression model that aims to assess racial discrimination in the context of police stops.^[Note that this example aims to illustrate a point about computation in an applied econometrics context. It does not make any argument about identification or the broader research question whatsoever.] The example is based on the 'Minneapolis Police Department 2017 Stop Dataset', containing data on nearly all stops made by the Minneapolis Police Department for the year 2017.

We start with importing the data into R.
```{r}
stopdata <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/carData/MplsStops.csv")
```

We specify a simple linear probability model that aims to test whether a stopped person identified as 'white' is less likely to have her vehicle searched when stopped by the police. In order to take into account level-differences between different police precincts, we add precinct-indicators to the regression specification

First, let's remove observations with missing entries (`NA`) and code our main explanatory variable and the dependent variable.

```{r}
# remove incomplete obs
stopdata <- na.omit(stopdata)
# code dependent var
stopdata$vsearch <- 0
stopdata$vsearch[stopdata$vehicleSearch=="YES"] <- 1
# code explanatory var
stopdata$white <- 0
stopdata$white[stopdata$race=="White"] <- 1
```


We specify our baseline model as follows. 

```{r}
model <- vsearch ~ white + factor(policePrecinct)
```

And estimate the linear probability model via OLS (the `lm` function).

```{r}
fit <- lm(model, stopdata)
summary(fit)
```

A potential problem with this approach (and there might be many more in this simple example) is that observations stemming from different police precincts might be correlated over time. If that is the case, we likely underestimate the coefficient's standard errors. There is a standard approach to compute estimates for so-called *cluster-robust* standard errors which would take the problem of correlation over time within clusters into consideration (and deliver a more conservative estimate of the SEs). However this approach only works well if the number of clusters in the data is roughly 50 or more. Here we only have 5. 

The alternative approach is typically to compute bootstrapped standard errors. That is, we apply the bootstrap resampling procedure at the cluster level. Specifically, we draw $B$ samples (with replacement), estimate and record for each bootstrap-sample the coefficient vector, and then estimate $SE_{boot}$ based on the standard deviation of all respective estimated coefficient values.

```{r message=FALSE}
# load packages
library(data.table)
# set the 'seed' for random numbers (makes the example reproducible)
set.seed(2)

# set number of bootstrap iterations
B <- 10
# get selection of precincts
precincts <- unique(stopdata$policePrecinct)
# container for coefficients
boot_coefs <- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2)
# draw bootstrap samples, estimate model for each sample
for (i in 1:B) {
     
     # draw sample of precincts (cluster level)
     precincts_i <- sample(precincts, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
     # get observations
     bs_i <- lapply(precincts_i, function(x) stopdata[stopdata$policePrecinct==x,])
     bs_i <- rbindlist(bs_i)
     
     # estimate model and record coefficients
     boot_coefs[i,] <- coef(lm(model, bs_i))[1:2] # ignore FE-coefficients
}
```


Finally, let's compute $SE_{boot}$.

```{r}
se_boot <- apply(boot_coefs, 
                 MARGIN = 2,
                 FUN = sd)
se_boot
```


Note that even with a very small $B$, computing $SE_{boot}$ takes up some time to compute. When setting $B$ to over 500, computation time will be substantial. Also note that running this code does hardly use up more memory then the very simple approach without bootstrapping (after all, in each bootstrap iteration the data set used to estimate the model is approximately the same size as the original data set). There is little we can do to improve the script's performance regarding memory. However we can tell R how to allocate CPU resources more efficiently to handle that many regression estimates.

Particularly, we can make use of the fact that most modern computing environments (such as a laptop) have CPUs with several *cores*. We can exploit this fact by instructing the computer to run the computations *in parallel* (simultaneously computing in several cores.). The following code is a parallel implementation of our bootstrap procedure which does exactly that.

```{r message=FALSE}
# install.packages("doSNOW", "parallel")
# load packages for parallel processing
library(doSNOW)

# get the number of cores available
ncores <- parallel::detectCores()
# set cores for parallel processing
ctemp <- makeCluster(ncores) # 
registerDoSNOW(ctemp)


# set number of bootstrap iterations
B <- 10
# get selection of precincts
precincts <- unique(stopdata$policePrecinct)
# container for coefficients
boot_coefs <- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2)

# bootstrapping in parallel
boot_coefs <- 
     foreach(i = 1:B, .combine = rbind, .packages="data.table") %dopar% {
          
          # draw sample of precincts (cluster level)
          precincts_i <- sample(precincts, size = 5, replace = TRUE)
          # get observations
          bs_i <- lapply(precincts_i, function(x) stopdata[stopdata$policePrecinct==x,])
          bs_i <- rbindlist(bs_i)
          
          # estimate model and record coefficients
          coef(lm(model, bs_i))[1:2] # ignore FE-coefficients
      
     }


# be a good citizen and stop the snow clusters
stopCluster(cl = ctemp)


```


As a last step, we compute again $SE_{boot}$.

```{r}
se_boot <- apply(boot_coefs, 
                 MARGIN = 2,
                 FUN = sd)
se_boot
```



## Case study: Memory allocation

Consider the first steps of a data pipeline in R. The first part of our script to import and clean the data looks as follows.

```{r eval = FALSE}
###########################################################
# Big Data Statistics: Flights data import and preparation
#
# U. Matter, January 2019
###########################################################

# SET UP -----------------

# fix variables
DATA_PATH <- "../data/flights.csv"

# DATA IMPORT ----------------
flights <- read.csv(DATA_PATH)

# DATA PREPARATION --------
flights <- flights[,-1:-3]



```

When running this script, we notice that some of the steps take a while. Moreover, while none of these steps obviously involves a lot of computation (such as a matrix inversion or numerical optimization), it quite likely involves memory allocation. We first read data into RAM (allocated to R by our operating system). It turns out that there are different ways to allocate RAM when reading data from a CSV file. Depending on the amount of data to be read in, one or the other approach might be faster. We first investigate the RAM allocation in R with `mem_change()` and `mem_used()`.

```{r}

# SET UP -----------------

# fix variables
DATA_PATH <- "../data/flights.csv"
# load packages
library(pryr) 


# check how much memory is used by R (overall)
mem_used()

# check the change in memory due to each step

# DATA IMPORT ----------------
mem_change(flights <- read.csv(DATA_PATH))

# DATA PREPARATION --------
flights <- flights[,-1:-3]

# check how much memory is used by R now
mem_used()
```

The last result is kind of interesting. The object `flights` must have been larger right after importing it than at the end of the script. We have thrown out several variables, after all. Why does R still use that much memory? R does by default not 'clean up' memory unless it is really necessary (meaning no more memory is available). In this case, R has still way more memory available from the operating system, thus there is no need to 'collect the garbage' yet. However, we can force R to collect the garbage on the spot with `gc()`. This can be helpful to better keep track of the memory needed by an analytics script.

```{r}
gc()
```


Now, let's see how we can improve the performance of this script with regard to memory allocation. Most memory is allocated when importing the file. Obviously, any improvement of the script must still result in importing all the data. However, there are different ways to read data into RAM. `read.csv()` reads all lines of a csv file consecutively. In contrast, `data.table::fread()` first 'maps' the data file into memory and only then actually reads it in line by line. This involves an additional initial step, but the larger the file, the less relevant is this first step with regard to the total time needed to read all the data into memory. By switching on the `verbose` option, we can actually see what `fread` is doing.

```{r}
# load packages
library(data.table)

# DATA IMPORT ----------------
flights <- fread(DATA_PATH, verbose = TRUE)

```


Let's put it all together and look at the memory changes and usage. For a fair comparison, we first have to delete `flights` and collect the garbage with `gc()`.

```{r}

# SET UP -----------------

# fix variables
DATA_PATH <- "../data/flights.csv"
# load packages
library(pryr) 
library(data.table)

# housekeeping
flights <- NULL
gc()

# check the change in memory due to each step

# DATA IMPORT ----------------
mem_change(flights <- fread(DATA_PATH))



```

Note that `fread()` uses up more memory. By default, `fread` does not parse strings as `factors` (and `read.csv()` does). Storing strings in factors is more memory efficient.


# Beyond memory

In the previous example we have inspected how RAM is allocated to store objects in the R computing environment. But what if all RAM of our computer is not enough to store all the data we want to analyze?

Modern operating systems have a way to dealing with such a situation. Once all RAM is used up by the currently running programs, the OS allocates parts of the memory back to the hard-disk which then works as *virtual memory*. The following figure illustrates this point.

```{r vm, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align='center', fig.cap= "(ref:vm)", purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/03_virtualmemory.png")
```

(ref:vm) Virtual memory. Figure by Ehamberg ([CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/)).

For example, when we implement an R-script that imports one file after the other into the R environment, ignoring the RAM capacity of our computer, the OS will start *paging* data to the virtual memory. This happens 'under the hood' without explicit instructions by the user. When this happens, we quite likely notice that the computer slows down a lot.

While this default usage of virtual memory by the OS is helpful to run several applications at the same time, each taking up a moderate amount of memory, it is not a really useful tool for processing large amounts of data in one application (R). However, the underlying idea of using both RAM and Mass storage simultaneously in order to cope with a lack of memory, is very useful in the context of big data statistics.

Several R packages have been developed that exploit the idea behind virtual memory explicitly for big data analytics. The basic idea behind these packages is to map a data set to the hard disk when loading it into R. The actual data values are stored in chunks on the hard-disk, while the structure/metadata of the data set is loaded into R. See @walkowiak_2016, Chapter 3 for more details and example code.
